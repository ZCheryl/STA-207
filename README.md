# Project STAR
Presenting the final report of STA 207 for team 2.

## Introduction

This report is an analysis of STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio) project data specifically targeted the 1st gradersâ€™ dataset with teacher as the unit (class-level average score). This report investigates the effect of class size (small, regular, regalar + aide) on the class-level mathematical performance on a standardized test. The analysis consists of the exploratory data analysis, two-way ANOVA, model diagnostics, hypothesis testing, and discussion of possible causal inference can be drawn from the STAR experiment.

In addition to the original report, the final report offers an extension section, providing various analysis on other factors that might have a significant influence student performance, such as school location and charateristics of teachers.
